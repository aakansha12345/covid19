# Covid19 data visualization 
As we all know about the dangerous world pandemic going on viz. 'COVID-19', I tried to visualize Covid-19 data using some graphs from matplotlib,Seaborn and using pandas. The data is coming from- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/covid-19/master/data/countries-aggregated.csv' which gets uploaded on daily basis.
